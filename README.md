# Payload Generator

A modular, beginner-friendly payload generation tool designed by our team for security testing and research.  
This project helps generate realistic, customizable payloads for testing web application vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and Command Injection — with handy encoding and obfuscation options built right in.

---

## ✨ Why We Built This

During penetration testing, payload generation can be repetitive and time-consuming.  
We wanted a lightweight, easy-to-use tool that:

✅ Supports multiple common attack vectors  
✅ Helps practice evasion techniques (encoding, obfuscation)  
✅ Makes payload creation simple, consistent, and fast  
✅ Is modular — so adding new techniques later is easy  

This project is intended for **educational use and authorized testing only**.

## 🧩 Features at a Glance

- ✅ XSS Payloads (Reflected, Stored, DOM, Bypass)  
- ✅ SQL Injection Payloads with optional evasion (comment obfuscation, etc.)  
- ✅ Command Injection Payloads for Linux & Windows  
- ✅ Built-in Encoders: Base64, URL encoding, Hex encoding, Unicode  
- ✅ Realistic, layered Obfuscation to bypass simple filters  
- ✅ Output options: Print to console, save to `.txt` or `.json`, copy to clipboard  
- ✅ Simple command-line interface  
- ✅ Fully modular code structure — easy to maintain and extend

💡 Future Ideas
Burp Suite extension version

GUI for easy, click-based payload generation

More payload types (SSTI, Path Traversal, etc.)

Advanced evasion techniques

Unit test coverage for stability
